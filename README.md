# Signal-Reconstruction-with-Cadzow-Smoothing
We show some examples of reconstructing a signal from noisy samplings using Cadzow Algorithm with a threshold given by: The optimal Threshold 
(4/sqrt(3))*sqrt(dim)*sigma. 
More on this optimal threshold can be found in the original paper: 
Gavish, M., & Donoho, D. L. (2014). The Optimal Hard Threshold for Singular Values is \(4/\sqrt {3}\) . 
IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, 60(8), 5040â€“5053. doi:10.1109/tit.2014.2323359 

we also implement Cadzow with a chosen rank for the Hankel matrices.

The examples show some cases where the smoothing with Cadzow is better than the least squares reconstruction.
